;; file-based storage
;;
;; We're using a text-based file format.  Each file is structured as a sequence of forms, where each form is a single object
;; (node or data), and the references between objects are in the form (form# offset) and the representation of such references
;; is always a fixed-size.  Accessing storage depends on all objects involved (both nodes and data) to have representations
;; created by cl:print-object and readable by cl:read.
;;
;; The first form of the file is the header, which contains a version number intended to describe the version number
;; of the file format.  The last two forms of the file are the footer and it's backup (that is, a copy of the footer
;; used for consistency checks). The 2nd form in the file should contain the "leaf node" representation, which in an
;; empty tree would also be the root.  All forms are terminated by #\Newline, although that also is a convenience,
;; and not a required delimiter between forms (because the Lisp reader does not
;; require that)

;; TODO note that the use of 20-char wide columns is because (length (format nil (expt 2 64))) is 20
